Class 1/15:

CMD commands to start application:
[1]
cd /D D:\Estudos\Programming\python\Python Flask Tutorial Full-Featured Web App Part 1\Flask_Blog\ 

[2]
set FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py

[3]
flask run

To open application on browser use the URL:

http://localhost:5000/

To refresh a browser page it's needed to reload the webserver via command line:

CRTL+C

redo start application commands

In order to avoid all this trouble whenever I want to reload the browser page we need to set another environment variable called FLASK_DEBUG equal to 1 instead of FLASK_APP="py file name"[2] and run flask[3] we can simply reload the browser page whenever we want to see a change

In order to accelerate this process we can set the following if statement:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True) 

in this file and whenever we want to start the application we simply type on the CMD:

python flaskblog.py


Class 2/15:

There is nothing stopping me from returning all my html code how It's been done in class 1/15, but that would be chaotic giving the size of the html codes. A better solution is to use templates. To use templates we first need to create a templates directory within our project (same level as our .py). Put your html files inside templates directory, importing render_template function form flask and intead of returning "html code" we can return render_template('home.html').
